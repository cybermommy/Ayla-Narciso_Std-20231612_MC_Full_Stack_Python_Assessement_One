### This is how the program meets the client's requirements:

### Fulfilling the Cart Conditions
### The provided code meets CloudX's Black Friday sale requirements through the implementation of a Cart class that adheres to the conditions for the promotional discount. This class empowers customers to manage their shopping experience by adding items to their carts, computing the total cost, and applying applicable discounts. Specifically, the discounted_price method is designed to apply a $50 discount if two conditions are met: the cart contains a minimum of 5 items, and the total reaches or exceeds $200. This integral functionality satisfies the core requirement of providing customers who fulfill these criteria with a $50 discount during the Black Friday sale.
### Showing Usage
### The main function within the provided code exemplifies the practical application of the Cart class. It offers a step-by-step showcase of how the class can be utilized, effectively illustrating the essential stages of the shopping process. The demonstration encompasses actions such as adding items to the cart, computing the total cost both before and after the discount is applied, and displaying the calculated results. This section provides a tangible insight into the functioning of the class within a shopping context. The example aligns with the client's goal of showcasing the Black Friday sale on an online platform. By creating a cart instance and emulating a diverse range of purchases, the code offers a clear representation of the class's operational dynamics.
### Using Unit Testing to Ensure Accuracy
### The Cart class's precision and reliability are validated through the incorporation of unit tests utilizing the unittest framework. Within the TestCart class, two distinct test cases are defined. The first, test_application_of_discount, ensures the precise application of the discount, while the second, test_total_calc, verifies the accurate calculation of the total price. By executing these tests, the program ascertains that the cart's discount logic and total calculation mechanisms function as intended. This rigorous testing approach empowers CloudX to ensure the seamless execution of their promotion and the alignment with customer expectations during the Black Friday sale.
